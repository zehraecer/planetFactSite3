In the Solar System, it is<br>the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the <br>third-most-massive planet, and the densest<br> giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth,<br> more massive than its near-twin Uranus.",

    "structure": {
      "content": "Neptune's internal structure resembles that of<br> Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5% to 10%<br> of its mass and extends perhaps 10% to 20% of<br> the way towards the core. Increasing <br>concentrations of methane, ammonia and <br>water are found in the lower regions.",

    "geology": {
      "content": "Neptune's atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and <br>19% helium. A trace amount of methane is also<br> present. Prominent absorption bands of <br>methane exist at wavelengths above 600 nm,<br> in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum.",
