      "content": "Mercury appears to have a solid silicate crust<br> and mantle overlying a solid, iron sulfide outer<br> core layer, a deeper liquid core layer, and a <br>solid inner core. The planet's density is the <br>second highest in the Solar System at 5.427<br> g/cm3 , only slightly less than Earth's density.",
