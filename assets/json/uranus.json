    "structure": {
      "content": "The standard model of Uranus's structure is<br> that it consists of three layers: a rocky<br> (silicate/iron–nickel) core in the centre, an icy<br> mantle in the middle and an outer gaseous<br> hydrogen/helium envelope. The core is<br> relatively small, with a mass of only 0.55 Earth <br>masses.",

    "geology": {
      "content": "The composition of Uranus's atmosphere is<br> different from its bulk, consisting mainly of<br> molecular hydrogen and helium. <br>The helium molar fraction, i.e. the number of helium atoms<br> per molecule of gas, is 0.15±0.03 in the upper<br> troposphere.",
