As the brightest natural object in<br> Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast<br>shadows and can be, on rare occasions, visible<br> to the naked eye in broad daylight.",

    "structure": {
      "content": "The similarity in size and density between <br>Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar <br>internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust. <br>Like that of Earth, Venusian core is most likely<br> at least partially liquid because the two planets <br>have been cooling at about the same rate.",

    "geology": {
      "content": "Much of the Venusian surface appears to have<br> been shaped by volcanic activity. Venus has<br> several times as many volcanoes as Earth, and<br> it has 167 large volcanoes that are over 100 km <br>(60 mi) across. The only volcanic complex of<br> this size on Earth is the Big Island of Hawaii.",
